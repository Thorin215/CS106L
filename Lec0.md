# introduction

## Goal: standard C++

1.learn what features are out there in c++ and why they exist

2.Become comfortable with reading c++

3.Become familiar eith the design philosophy of modern C++

## History of C++

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
    
}
```

向后兼容：兼容c和asm

### Assembly

hard to understand 

Complier

C : cs107

## Evolution of C++

1.classes

c++98 c++11 c++17 c++20

## Design Plilosophy of C++

ALLow the programmer full control 

Easy to understand 

```cpp
vector<int> vec = {1,2,3};
int sum = 0;
for (auto val:vec){
    sum +=val;
}
```

Don't waste time or space
